== Getting Started with AeroGear Services Android SDK

Following guide provides general information for starting with AeroGear Services SDK.

== Prerequisites

You will need the following installed on your system  

 * Android SDK or Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html[Google]

It is reccomended you have the following installed  

 * The latest version of http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html[OpenJDK]

== Installing

As of the writing of this guide, the Aerogear Android SDK is not in jcenter and needs to be installed manually.

=== Clone and build the library

[source, sh]
----
git clone https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-sdk
cd aerogear-android-sdk
./gradlew install
----

You can verify the install went well by checking your local maven repository

----
ls ~/.m2/repository/org/aerogear

# Should output auth core
----

== Using the SDK

=== MavenLocal()

If you are using a build of the SDK from source you will need to add mavenLocal() to the build.gradle file in your project's root directory.

[source, groovy]
----
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal() // <-- Add This line
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}
----

=== Reference the Dependencies

In the build.gradle file for your app you can begin adding dependencies provided by the sdk.

----
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'org.aerogear:core:5.0.0-SNAPSHOT'
    implementation 'org.aerogear:auth:5.0.0-SNAPSHOT' //If you are using IDM services provided by KeyCloak
}
----

=== Using the SDK

In an example you can use the SDK as follows

[source, java]
----

public class MyApplication extends Application {

    private MobileCore mobileCore;
    private MetricsService metricsService;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();

        mobileCore = MobileCore.init(this);
        metricsService = mobileCore.getInstance(MetricsService.class);

        metricsService.sendAppAndDeviceMetrics();
    }

    @Override
    public void onTerminate() {
        super.onTerminate();

        mobileCore.destroy();
    }

}

----

== Bill of materials

Our project provides a BOM artifact to lock the dependencies (direct and transitive) down to known compatible versions. 
Gradle itself does not offer such a mechanism but it is a well known and used concept in the Maven world (see link:https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html#Dependency_Management[Dependency Management]
).

In order to bring this functionality to Gradle the Android SDK relies on the link:https://github.com/spring-gradle-plugins/dependency-management-plugin[dependency management plugin] provided by Spring. This plugin allows us to use a standard Maven BOM in a Gradle project.

== Setting up project to use any AeroGear Services SDK

1. Add gradle plugin to 
At the top of your gradle build file (but below `buildscripts`) add the plugin itself:

----
plugins {
    id "io.spring.dependency-management" version "1.0.4.RELEASE"
}
----

1. Import bom plugin into your gradle config
Add following code before your `dependencies` add the `dependencyManagement` section that refers to our BOM:

----
dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom 'org.jboss.aerogear:aerogear-android-sdk-bom:1.1.10'
    }
}
----

1. In case your project contains multiple modules you need to apply this to all your subprojects. Make sure to apply the previous steps to your parent modules `build.gradle` and wrap the `dependencyManagement` section as follows:

----
subprojects {
    apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'

    dependencyManagement {
        imports {
            mavenBom 'org.jboss.aerogear:aerogear-android-sdk-bom:1.1.10'
        }
    }
}
----


1. After applying this changes developers can import the dependencies that are listed in the BOM without specifying a version:

----
dependencies {
    implementation group: 'org.aerogear', name: 'core'
}
----

== Importing individual SDK

Please follow individual SDK's documentation to see how to add them to the project

 * link:./core.adoc[Core]
 * link:./auth.adoc[Auth] 

== Certificate Pinning

To implement certificate pinning in the individual SDKs, see link:./certificate-pinning.adoc[the certificate pinning guide].
