== Accessing Custom Keycloak User Attributes

Keycloak allows creating custom http://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#user-attributes[User Attributes] on top of the default attributes that OpenID Connect provides.
By default, these are not exposed in the Identity or Access tokens. You will need to use the Keycloak http://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#_protocol-mappers[Token Mapper] to define any extra attributes that you want in the tokens.

=== Setting User Attributes

User attributes can be added under the *Attributes* tab of a *User*. Here you can define any attributes you want. In this example, I created the Key `customAttribute` with the Value `test`.

=== Configuring the Token Mapper

The next step we need to do is to allow this attribute to be sent in the tokens. To do this, we need to choose our *Client* and then select the *Mappers* tab.
Then click the *Create* button to create a new token mapper. Choose the Name of the mapper, the User Attribute it references (in this case we chose `customAttribute`) and then choose a Token Claim Name.
The Token Claim Name is the Key name that the User Attribute will be shown under in the JSON in the decoded Token. You should then set the Claim JSON Type to match the type of data your User Attribute is.
Optionally, you can also specify which tokens you want this attribute to be sent in.

=== Inspecting Our Token
In we authenticate in our client application, we can now see that the `customAttribute` is being included in the Identity/Access Tokens.

```
{
...
"customAttribute":"test",
"name":"User 1",
"preferred_username":"user1",
"given_name":"User",
"family_name":"1",
"email":"user1@feedhenry.org"
}
```
