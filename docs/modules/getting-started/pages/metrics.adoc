= AeroGear Services Metrics SDK

This document explains how to use the AeroGear Metrics SDK on the Android platform and integrate it with an App.

== Using metrics

The Metrics service is part of the Core SDK and no additional dependency is required to use it.
All you have to do is to make sure that your `mobile-services.json` contains a configuration section for it.
You can verify this with the mobile cli:

```
$ mobile get clientconfig <app id> --namespace=<project> -o json
```

The result should include a `metrics` section inside the `services` array.
If no such configuration is provided then the Metrics module will not send any data over the network but will still log the data to the console and you can view them in Logcat or another remote logging solution. Once you initialize the core SDK some default metrics will be collected and sent.

== Provided metrics

The default metrics contain App metrics, Device metrics and possibly other types in the future.
A Client ID and a timestamp are added to the top level of the Metrics object for categorization and visualization purposes.
The Client ID will be generated and stored on the device when the App is started the first time.

It is currently not possible to record custom metrics data.

=== App metrics

- *App ID*: The package name of your App
- *App version*: The version of your App as defined in the top level `build.gradle`
- *SDK version*: The version of the Aerogear SDK that is used

=== Device metrics

- *Platform*: Hardcoded to `android`
- *Platform Version*: The API level of the device
